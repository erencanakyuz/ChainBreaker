## Previous Errors (FIXED):

### 1. Phaser Version Issue - ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `starGraphics.fillStar is not a function`
**Cause**: Phaser 3.55.2 was too old and didn't support fillStar method
**Solution**: 
- Updated Phaser from 3.55.2 → 3.70.0 (latest stable)
- Implemented custom star drawing function as fallback
- Used manual path drawing with beginPath(), moveTo(), lineTo(), closePath(), fillPath()

### 2. Color.js Import Issue - ✅ FIXED  
**Error**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`
**Cause**: Color.js library was trying to use ES6 modules which aren't compatible with script tags
**Solution**:
- Removed Color.js dependency completely
- Rewritten ColorSystem class to use only Chroma.js
- Used Chroma.js methods: chroma(), .get(), .hsl(), .hex()
- Added hexToPhaser() helper method

### 3. Canvas Performance Warning - ✅ ADDRESSED
**Warning**: `Canvas2D: Multiple readback operations using getImageData are faster with the willReadFrequently attribute set to true`
**Status**: This is a browser optimization warning, not a breaking error
**Note**: Already addressed in previous conversation with willReadFrequently: true

### 4. Phaser 3.70 Particle System Changes - ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `createEmitter removed. See ParticleEmitter docs for info`
**Cause**: Phaser 3.70 changed particle system API - removed createEmitter method
**Solution**:
- Updated all particle systems to new syntax: `this.add.particles(x, y, texture, config)`
- Replaced `createEmitter()` with direct particle configuration
- Changed `on: false` to `emitting: false`
- Updated method calls: `emitter.start()` → `particles.start()`
- Fixed explode calls: `emitter.explode()` → `particles.explode()`
- Updated setTint calls: `emitter.setTint()` → `particles.setTint()`

### 5. Particle setTint Method Issue - ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `cannot read properties undefined SetTint`
**Cause**: Phaser 3.70 particle system doesn't support dynamic setTint() method
**Solution**:
- Removed all `setTint()` calls on particle systems
- Particle colors are now configured during creation in the config object
- Colors remain consistent based on selected game mode palette
- Static tinting more performance-friendly than dynamic tinting

### 6. Timeline Method Removed - ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `this.tweens.timeline is not a function`
**Cause**: Phaser 3.70 removed the tweens.timeline method
**Solution**:
- Replaced `this.tweens.timeline()` with chained individual tweens
- Used `onComplete` callbacks to sequence animations
- Maintained same visual effect with manual tween chaining
- Score popup animations work identically to before
